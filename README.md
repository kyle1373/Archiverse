## About Archiverse

Archiverse is a website to view the Miiverse archive taken by [Archive Team](https://archiveteam.org) in September and October 2017. It consists of a parsed database collection of Miiverse posts, profiles, and community pages, linking back to the Internet Archive. The goal of Archiverse is to make it easier to both view the web archives (WARCs), as well as link everything back to the original WARC files for retrieving the primary assets.
