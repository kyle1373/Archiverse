# Archiverse Frontend

Archiverse uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) in order to run the website.

## Getting Started

First, create a `.env` file based on the `.env-example` format. To get your local database credentials, follow the instructions in the `supabase` directory (which is outside of `archiverse`). After you set up your local supabase instance, copy and paste those values into your `.env`.  

`npm i` to install node dependencies. You should see `node_modules`  

Now, run `npm run dev` to start the development server. You should see the server run at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
